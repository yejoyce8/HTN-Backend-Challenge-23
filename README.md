# Hack the North 2021 Backend Boilerplate

This boilerplate contains boilerplate for a REST Express app on Node. The current directory is mounted as a volume under `/src/app` so
that you do not have to rebuild the image every time (along with `node_modules`). Building and running the image will start the Express server on port
5000.

Good luck!
